<h3><strong>Paris,Texas ★★☆☆☆</strong></h3>

<p><strong>The scene with Travis and Hunter running across the road on opposite sides is honestly one of my favourite scenes in history of cinema. Ahh!! Movies can be sick sometimes.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h3><strong>Through the Olive Trees ★★☆☆☆</strong></h3>
<td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Through_the_Olive_Trees_poster.jpg" height="190" width="320"</td>
<p><strong> The color essesnce of a peaceful life; running through with faith or love. The oneiric harmony between humanity and nature found in the wind that caresses gently the olive trees. Cinema; transcended. Life; affirmed. The movie of a true man, poet. We are not worthy.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h3><strong>Scenes from a Marriage ★★★☆☆</strong></h3>

<p><strong>< I watch a movie or miniseries directed by Bergman, it never fails to leave a huge impact on me for days. His work is unmatched, he was truly born with a gift.</strong</p>
<hr>

<h3><strong>Noroi: The Curse ★★★★☆</strong></h3>
<td><img src="https://media.gq.com/photos/5f96e33ddbdba4b869c3c9a8/master/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/story%20dnc%20Noroi%20the%20Curse%20perfect%20horror%20movie%20gq%20october%202020.jpg" height="180" width="320"</td>
<p><strong>Took me long enough to watch it. Pure,smoothering dread. Grainly found footage like this is just perfect for an atmosphere of ghastly dreams, a spell descending on our minds. Really love the evil synth soundtrack, too.</strong></p>
